# Workload

The main objective of this workload is the creation of an online guest book. The software should run on a fairly standard Ubuntu-Server setup.
The following points are the basic requirements for this assignment.
1. List of all the entries made to the guestbook in the past.
2. A form to add a new entry to the guestbook.
A simple WYSIWYG editor would add to the user experience, but choose wisely how many formatting options you are going to grant the author of a new comment. The user should not be able to fuck up your design or security.
3. “Mini-Backend” where you can delete entries. This section should be protected by a password. Consider to implement the most basic security measures.

### Backend
It is up to you if you use a framework or plain PHP on the server.
You can, but don’t have to use a SQL Database for your data storage. Bonus: Try to think of ways to protect the Backend from attackers.

### Frontend
The Frontend should look decent in all modern Browsers including Edge, Firefox and Chrome. Data should be exchanged with the frontend via Ajax. Just any simple Object notation will do ;)
Bonus: If you want you can use a reactive Javascript Library like Vue.

### Distribution
Upload your final project to a Git repository.
You chose if you want to make the repository public or private.
